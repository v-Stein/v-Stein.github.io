# To declare a variable, simply declare the type of it and its name

String myVariable;


# You can also assign a value to this variable inline its declaration

String myVariable = "Foobar";


# If you don't want this variable to be changed, you can set it to constant with a '!' before the type

!String myVariable = "I can't be changed!";

# Note: Remember that if you declare a constant without value, it will have a "None" value forever
!String myVariable; #--> None


# If you try to change a constant, it will throw a ImmutableConstViolationError

!String myVariable = "I can't be changed!";
myVariable = "But still I try."; #--> ImmutableConstViolationError


# Also, you can't change the type of a variable if it is already declared

String myVariable = "I'm a string.";
Int myVariable = 42; #--> TypeMutationError


# Same thing happens if you try to put a different type value in a variable

String myVariable = "I'm a string.";
myVariable = 42; #--> InvalidTypeError
